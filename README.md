# Fake_News_Detection_Algorithm_PassiveAggressiveClassifier
The model I've chosen to use is the Passive-Aggressive (PA) Classifier (see original paper here). In essence, the PA classifier is an algorithm that only updates its weights ("aggressive" action) when it encounters examples for which its predictions are wrong, but otherwise remains unchanged ("passive" action).
